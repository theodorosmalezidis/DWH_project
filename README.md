# DWH_project

# Introduction

This project is my first step into data engineering and demonstrates the end-to-end development of a data warehouse tailored for an investment firm. The goal is to organize raw data stored across multiple sources into a structured, analytics-ready platform optimized for reporting and decision-making.

# Goals

A) Build a modern data warehouse (DWH) optimized for scalability,performance and maintainability, ensuring it can handle growing data volumes.

B) Structure the data to provide BI-ready datasets, enabling seamless consumption by the firmâ€™s data analysts for reporting and decision-making.

# Dataset

In this project, I simulated the creation of the raw data using Python, trying to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world datasets from an investment firm.

# My Tools for the Project

- **Python:**  A flexible programming language with tons of helpful libraries that made it easy for me to create my dataset. 
- **SQL Server (SQLS):**  A powerful database system I used to store my data and run fast, efficient queries. 
- **SQL:**  The go-to language I used to interact with my data. 
- **Git:**  My trusty version control tool that helped me keep track of changes. 
- **GitHub:**  Where I shared my SQL scripts and kept everything organized, making it easier to track progress. 
- **Draw.io:**  A simple yet powerful tool I used to design and visualize the architecture of my data warehouse.
